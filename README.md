the project does not work with current laravel versions, I wrote it when there was a laravel 10+ version, so it does not adapt to new features.
to run the project, it is enough to write "php artisan serve" in the terminal.

this is a promotional site for veterinarians. the main page is like this. (I didn't deal much with the css part because I focused on the backend part).
![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66e8944e-ef88-4a07-87ee-8962b463f330)

there is a section for promoting the clinic under who we are. (the information on the page does not belong to me, I got it from a veterinary site)
![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9de1c1fe-069b-48dc-a20d-616ccce200aa)

there is a drop-down section for the services of the clinic. I have also added pages describing the services provided in detail.( I wrote the services section just for example)
![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/127d166e-dc40-4214-959d-9ae805e7956e)

I have added a page for communication with the clinic. in addition to the number of the clinic, the whatsapp number of the clinic can be accessed by clicking the link at the bottom. i have also added a google map link of the clinic for transportation.

the login section supports login with different social media tools.
![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edfbf257-6c64-45fa-a7c9-7f9a88d487de)

there is a transition from login to register tab and from register tab to login tab.
![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e15c9bb2-96d1-4f60-9ec0-a5ea68c24ccd)

I added an algorithm that checks the password creation rules in the registration section.
![7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f25c1b79-60a4-483d-bf9e-b7178c01f833)

similarly, I added a feature to check that the passwords are the same.

only logged in users can access the add products section, but the added products can be seen without logging in.

![14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c21c739-5b20-4a36-b505-52e681b0d895)
product details can also be accessed via the blue button on the right side.(sorry for the photo, I wanted to put my cat)
![15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9f38676-7790-416d-b361-14f67e364829)

I am attaching an example to show how I add products.
![10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3774ca66-46e6-4025-811a-17f2bbc710d4)

after the product is added, it gives confirmation that the product has been added. (green colored part) 
![11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58b2dec3-2113-4f04-9ecb-7316cc317240)

after registering on the site, a code is sent to confirm the registered e-mail and you cannot switch to the add product tab without confirming this code.
![12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52555886-bfaf-4572-8e4c-2184077468c2)

I have attached a photo to show that the email came through mailtrap because I logged in with a non-real email.
![13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a77024af-56ba-4873-9efa-8b99cc067331)

I added profile editing, password change and 2FA pages for logged in users only, respectively. I used Google Authenticator in the 2FA section.
